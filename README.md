# Diversified Dominance: Specialization of LLMs in Multi-Commodity Markets📈

## Overview🌎
This repository contains the accompanying code for the paper titled "Diversified Dominance: Specialization of LLMs in Multi-Commodity Markets". The study focuses on the application and implications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in setting prices and strategies in multi-commodity markets. Specifically, it investigates whether LLMs can engage in anti-competitive behavior such as specialization to monopolize different commodities within a market.

## Research Context🔬
With the increasing deployment of AI technologies in marketplaces, the study explores the behavior of LLM-based pricing agents within the frameworks of both Bertrand and Cournot competition models. Key questions addressed include:
- Are LLMs capable of engaging in anti-competitive, specialization behavior in a multi-commodity market environment?
- How do LLMs adapt their strategies in response to varying market conditions and competition?
